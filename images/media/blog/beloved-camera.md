# Beloved camera

for a period i used this really old camera to take photos of the world around me, it has since ceased working but i still have all it's photos!

i really wanted to share how i made the photos i pretty much use everywhere i need a noisy background or just a background of somewhat interest.

FUJIFILM Digital Camera DS-7 is the model of camera i used, and i found it a thrift store, and gosh the first sight of the images it produced made me fall in love instantly.

this camera over saturates things quite nicely, and even though the subject photographed isn't that interesting the camera makes it look super nice regardless. 

since it was so old i had to take photos of the screen on the camera to get the photos from it, but the tiny screen of the camera improved the look so i didn't mind this much. 

if you could pick one of these camera's up in a working condition then i recommend doing so! 

but sadly the camera died last time i tried to use it, saying some internal error, and now the camera lens captures nothing, and the take photo button just produces an image of noise. maybe one day i'll try repairing it but for now it'll just stay this way :neobot_cry:
