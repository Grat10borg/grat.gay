# Hello Orbit.

I'm Grat10 and i'd like to welcome you to my personal website on the internet super highway!
here i plan to post a bunch of my old tutorials & ofc some new blog posts in between them :neobot_happy:

the topics will likely be within most of my hobbies which include pixelart, sewing, streaming, baking & 3D
or just any thoughts i want to air out, if that's of any interest check back in once in awhile!!

i write these blog posts from Obsidian, i've set up a vault in the directory my script picks up files! this makes me able to fully create blog posts from within it! even with the metadata needed, that and i have to remember the file paths to files i want to put in the blog post. 

i don't know how often i'll write blog posts frankly but the fact that it exists now is probably already a step towards using it.
oh and yeah thanks to keymotes i've also got access to all the emotes used on social.grat.gay my fediverse instance! 

i plan to try to add as much to this website as possible, eventually. sadly i'm just quite slow at webdev, and get distracted easilly, but now that the basic site is here it should be less work to get more added! hoping so atleast :neobot_nervous:

oh- and if you're on firefox enjoy the animated favicon of Grat10 (sorry chrome users) the favicon will also change to Grat10 sleeping if you leave the tab for awhile. and she'll dance if you use the music player heheh!! for more of what she does you'll just have to find out when i uhh add more :neobot_woozy:
### aside

on the banner image is my character Wiitri!! i made her in crocotile3D, she's based of these laboratory CRT i found an image of online, and as i was learning lowpoly at the time i thought it was an easy shape to try and re-create!   

## so like to end off

thanks for stopping by and leave any thoughts you might have in my comment box its the speech bubble gear on the left bottom of the screen!
