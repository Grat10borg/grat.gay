# Web growing pains

this website has taken ages, and by that i mean several years, i've been redesigning and remaking this site for 2 years give or take. 

with this version i'm mostly happy with it!! ofc i'd like to refine it to all hell and add so much more to it but design wise it's all basically here, and it carries my energy well i feel!! 

this is the site of a blue robot vtuber, and reads as such! but still for memories sake and also to see how an idea can evolve we should look at all the previous versions of my website! :neobot_think:

# Early 2023
this is the very very first version of the site, i was trying to replicate how old sites were so i kinda threw all of my website making knowledge out of the window, up to this point i was mainly reliant on bootstrap.

and you can sorta tell with how badly the site was put up, it had a nice vibe to it still with the paper cutouts of Grat10 and such. it had an iframe for my twitch channel embedded on the front page, as i was unsure how i'd call the Twitch API without leaking my API key publicly :neobot_woozy:

sorry about the quality of this screenshot too i had to take it from a stream of me making the site, as i didn't think about taking screen-caps of the website till then next version. the site was fully static as in fully HTML and CSS as i guess it wanted to try not using it. 

this wasn't the best choice as it made updating the site more of a hassle making me not do it, and instead returning immediately to the drawing board.

 # later 2023 
 when i said i went back to the drawing board i meant it, as i actually drew mockups for this version! but just not in the best program for the job, i chose MSpaint as i didn't know any better,,

the mockups helped me nail a good theming and this version does have it's design a lot more together than the previous one, but it ran into problems with being mobile firendly (a trend)

i drew pretty much in what i knew i'd be able to do with CSS at my skill level so the site is somewhat basic still, but overall not too bad! though i don't think this version of the site went up either... whoops!

i was really proud of myself when i got the folders to work with a bit of JavaScript code, which hides Grat10 and can also show a bunch of lists and detail tags with infomation about myself!

and beneath that there was another folder that would displayer either my newest posts from VT.Social, my fediverse instance at the time, or my twitch channel iframe!

the site news text area also was a text file i fetched locally which was the first time i did that sorta thing with JavaScript as up till this point i was using PHP for such things instead, not knowing JS could do it too awawawa :neobot_happy:

it also had a clock on the page as i thought that was a neat thing to add, the site style still holds up it feels, and reflects a "Grat10" site well.

# 2024 
this time it was a bit different, i had just been introduced to Lunacy a graphic design program! and after toying around in it for long enough i decided i wanted to try and make mockups for my website and give it another go!

this time i wasn't really as burdened by my artistic skills of MSpaint :neobot_woozy: and the mockup actually looks near identical to the site as it looks here

i also reused the artwork i commissioned from Mimzyy and cut out parts of it so i could animate the arm move up forward and backwards, which made the site really feel alive, that and making the gears spin when hovered.

this site was put together a lot better mechanically but still had the problem of mobile friendliness which i could not solve as the images wouldn't fit on a phone regardless of what i tried. 

it was too wide an image and it wouldn't look well on mobile without having to commission another splash artwork, something not realllyy in the budget at the time.

but still this sites design is quite interesting, as it is for the most part not set up like the typical website and more like that of a desktop. with a navigation UI at the top and footer at the bottom, it also has floating text on artwork and above the artwork.

and ofc it used windows which you could dismiss and drag around. the chatbox gear would also open up a window all the same as the one you see when opening the page.

this has been the page thats been pushed and been on my neocities for a long, long time. and by far it's the most Grat10 site yet! so i was making progress  awawawa, and the movement was def something i liked a lot, and wanted to keep.

![Grat10 doing a post resting against the bottom of the page against a blue noisy background, theres a floating window beside her notifying the user the page is unfinished, theres a decorated border to the navbar above her and a big orange Streaming on twitch.tv button aswell as a white navbar and several floating gears and text with artist credits around](images/ogp/2024/hub.png)

this page felt too good design wise to just be left to be forgotten, so i chose to make a reference to it in this sites Open-Graph-Protocol preview image.

![a preview for the website where the image of Grat10 is tinted more blue and she has a shadow on her with big text saying Grat.gay the dark blue navbar and white footer is still there but drawn more minimally](images/ogp/2025/ogp_main.webp)
so in a way this page lives on still awawawa, now just as a preview for this site instead, i was thinking of making it animated as well but i felt too time constrained to do so, maybe i'll add it in the future though.

as for this version of the site it only had one other page, and that was the character page, where you could look up each of my characters to see lore about them, this planned for this site aswell just hasn't been made yet! so stay tuned for that awawaa :miku_cat_sitting:

so obviously this has been a long time coming but im glad to finally release my site out into the public and be content with how it looks and works. polish i think i'll always need to add but for now this is about the best i can make!

and now with the tools and what i've learned im happy i stayed determined to finish this! but i'm also tired from having this be on the back burner for years on end, holding off on doing projects cuz of a site left unfinished.

but maybe once this site has gone public i'll take a breather finally and work on that sewing project again, fix OBS and stream again or focus on something new entirely.

oh and do artwork, gotta fill out the gallery and finish it :neobot_happy:

thanks for reading, you feel so tied to a project after awhile i wonder how it'll feel to be done awa.
